PayPal Here&trade; Sideloader API
==================

This project contains 3 very lightweight samples for Android, iOS & Web that show how PayPal Here&trade; can be integrated into your own projects using the Sideloader API.
___
For a brief overview of the API and what you can do with it: Have a look at our [Keynote at the MWC's WIPJam 2013](http://www.slideshare.net/PayPal/mwc-keynote) (at our [SlideShare channel](http://www.slideshare.net/PayPal/)).

Basically you need either a phone with Android or iOS with our PayPal Here&trade; app installed. To accept payments using PayPal Here&trade; you need a valid PayPal merchant account that is registered for PayPal Here&trade; in the supported countries.

The Sideloader API uses an url scheme to communicate with PayPal's app and retrieve the payment's result via a callback mechanism.

Using this allows you to accept payments via:

* Credit card
* PayPal
* Checkin
* Invoice
* Cash
